### I was originally working on [Solitaire](https://github.com/9701836/Solitaire/tree/gh-pages), but after seeing the complexity of an example, I opted for a more simple turn based combat game. I have created a basic back and forth system. It has an attack option and a dummy option for creating a multiple option combat system.
